This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s curriculum. 
The project page can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-weather-app).

The goal of this project is to create a simple weather by fetching data from WeatherAPI and using asynchronous functions.

Not finished, but it currently shows current temp, highs/lows for current day and next 2 days, as well as condition icons for each day.
